purple monkey dishwasher
no beer no tv make something something
and this is the snack holder where I can put my beverage
the goggles they do nothing
give me some inner peach
which one of you is the mailman
have been either drunk or on cocaine
doughnuts I told you I don't like ethnic food
I'm lucky if I can find a half hour to get funky
Remember Alf
I don't want to look like a weirdo I'll just get a muumuu
you resist the urge to punch them in the face
don't make me run I'm full of chocolate
